This is the Code Book associated with run_analysis.R.

The program run_analysis.R does the following.
 - Reads the data into R and combines all data for test group and all data for training group.  (Each group has 3 text files â€“ one representing the subject, one the activity, and one the measurements associated with 66 feature variables.)
 - Establishes a variable that identifies the group (either test or train).
 - Combines test group data and training group data into one data frame.
 - Reads the activity descriptions associated with the labels.
 - Adds the activity descriptions onto the records.
 - Reads in column names for the original data and renames the columns.
 - Builds a list of variables representing means and standard deviations.
 - Chooses only the data corresponding to means and standard deviations.  (This is step 4 of the project!)
 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 - utputs the tidy dataset.
